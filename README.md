# install.sh
My script to setup a Kali machine with everything that I need

## Install

1. `git clone https://github.com/seeu-inspace/install.sh.git` or download the script
2. `cd install.sh`
3. `chmod +x install.sh`
4. `./install.sh`

## Notes

If it doesn't run or you get an error like `zsh: ./install.sh: bad interpreter: /bin/bash^M: no such file or directory`, try the following command:
```
dos2unix install.sh
```
